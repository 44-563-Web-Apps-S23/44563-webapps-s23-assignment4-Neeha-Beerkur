     <h1>Neeha Beerkur "snips a play"</h1>
     <p> THE STRONGER[M]


        <p class="speech">SCENE: _A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
        cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs._<br></p>
   
        <h6 class="MRS">MRS. X.</h6><p class="speech"> _enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
        pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.<br></p>
   
        <h6 class="MISS">MISS Y.</h6> <p class="speech">_has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
        is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
        exchanges it for a new one_.<br></p>
   
   <h6 class="MRS">MRS. X.</h6> <p class="speech">Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
   lonely as a poor bachelor.<br></p>
   
       <p class="direction">[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
        her reading_.]<br></p>
   
   <h6 class="MRS">MRS. X.</h6> <p class="speech">Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
   restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
   when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
   reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
   witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
   Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
   to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
   dear.<br></p>
   
       <p class="direction">[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X.,
        _and disappears again_.<br></p>
   
   <h6 class="MRS">MRS. X.</h6> <p class="speech"> <p class="direction">[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
   of Christmas presents._]</p> See what I've bought for my tots. <p>[_Picks up a
   doll._]</p> What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
   eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
   pistol for Carl.<br></p>
   
       <p class="direction"> [_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ <h6>MISS Y. MISS Y.</h6> _starts as if
        frightened_.<br></p>
   
   <h6 class="MRS">MRS. X.</h6> <p class="speech"> Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
   did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
   were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
   in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
   it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
   didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
   matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
   <p class="direction">[_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._]</p> Well, these are for my
   hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
   must have them on everything.<br></p>
